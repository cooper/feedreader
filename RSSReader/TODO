√   FeedListVC needs to not be dependent on all of the feeds in the group
    but instead on a group of feeds (Feed collection).
    This will allow grouping feeds by category, etc.
    Never mind. I decided that a group is essentially a feed collection.
    I can't 'think of a situation where it would be necessary to show
    articles from two different feed groups together.

√   ArticleListVC needs to not be dependent on all the articles in a feed
    but instead on a group of articles (Article collection).
    This will allow grouping of feeds and ordering all the articles
    together by date (as per the requirements of the application).

√   Hmm, what if you wanted to store a feed in more than one group...?
    I will replace the group property with currentGroup or something
    similar that represents the one being dealt with on the interface
    currently.

√   Articles need to be stored in a dictionary rather than an array
    and by their identifier strings, and they should be updated rather
    than appended in storage if they exist already.

*   The entire thing needs to utilize Core Data.

Ideas
-----

* Wouldn't it be neat if we analyzed the articles and generated statistics such as
  most commonly used words, trending topics, etc.?

* I should use the same type of menu as in the weather app for switching between feed
  groups. I like that menu, and it seems appropriate.
