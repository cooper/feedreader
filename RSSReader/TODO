*   FeedListVC needs to not be dependent on all of the feeds in the group
    but instead on a group of feeds (Feed collection).
    This will allow grouping feeds by category, etc.
    Never mind. I decided that a group is essentially a feed collection.
    I can't 'think of a situation where it would be necessary to show
    articles from two different feed groups together.

*   ArticleListVC needs to not be dependent on all the articles in a feed
    but instead on a group of articles (Article collection).
    This will allow grouping of feeds and ordering all the articles
    together by date (as per the requirements of the application).

*   Hmm, what if you wanted to store a feed in more than one group...?
    I will replace the group property with currentGroup or something
    similar that represents the one being dealt with on the interface
    currently.
